# //a tuple is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after
# creation, making them "immutable." Here's a comprehensive overview of tuples in Python:

city = ("agra", "mumbai", "delhi")
# print(city[2])

# city[0]="jaipur"
# print(city)

# slice = city[1:2]
# print(slice)

# people = ("aditya", "vishal", "rohit")
# addition = city  + people
# print(addition)
